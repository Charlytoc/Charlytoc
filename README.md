# Hello visitor!

If you are here, you may have found the link to my profile on some of my different social media platforms. Let me describe myself in a few lines.

### Who am I?
My name is Charly. I love solving problems, cooking, traveling, making videos, sharing my knowledge with the world, and I'm a **Fullstack engineer** with experience in a lot of technologies, with a preference for working in:
- Python: With Django, FastAPI, or Flask, a lot of libraries for video, audio, text generation, AI, sockets, data analysis, and more.
- Typescript/Javascript: I'm a static typing lover, I love to have clean and documented code, and I use Typescript to do so. With these languages, I have worked with React, NextJs, ViteJs, Socket.io, parsing libraries, components, Tailwind, and more.
- HTML/CSS: Web development was my first encounter with programming, so I love it. I enjoy writing my own styles and animated elements.
- Docker, Pandas, AWS...

That was a small review of my knowledge. I hope you find what you are looking for.
